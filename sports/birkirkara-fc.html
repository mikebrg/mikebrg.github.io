					<h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Club History</strong></h1>
					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Football in Birkirkara dates back to the year 1916. Salvu Troisi, a famous Msida player who later joined Floriana, founded a club called Birkirkara United. This club, together with Birkirkara Celtic, laid the foundations of the present Birkirkara Football Club. Birkirkara Football Club was established in 1950 after the amalgamation of both clubs, when the Committees of these two teams agreed to sacrifice their clubs in an attempt to build a team capable of challenging for club honours on a national scale. Amongst the persons who worked hard to establish this dream were Wigi Borg, Carmelo Micallef, John Baptist Galea, Eleno Borg and Paul Gauci.
<br>
<br>The first club premises which were bought, were situated in Main Street, a few meters away from the small church dedicated to St. Paul. The club premises were not much but it was a place where at least all committee members and supporters could meet. Once the club premises were purchased, the attention turned towards the team. Lolly Rizzo, Emanuel Borg, Victor Farrugia and Lolly Cuschieri were amongst the first players to form part of Birkirkara F.C. The team was further strengthened by the coach Mr. Frankie Tabone from the then famous Ajax side. Tabone was engaged as a player coach. The team did not have an official training ground and most training was carried out in the streets of Birkirkara. The Metropole cinema, which was still under construction, was also used as a training ground. This problem was only resolved when the Education Ministry permitted Birkirkara F.C. to train at the Government Primary School (Brared Street) and later at the Imriehel Technical School. Once all these problems were settled, Birkirkara F.C. were ready to join the "big boys".</p>

						<strong>1950s</strong></h1>
					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The baptism of fire proved to be too much for the Yellow-Reds. Losing match after match, Birkirkara F.C. were relegated to the second division. Season 1950/51 was no better. Birkirkara F.C. just managed to avoid relegation to the 3rd Division courtesy of a 4-1 win over Naxxar Lions in a relegation decider.
<br>
<br>Season 1951/52 was totally different. Birkirkara won all the matches and were promoted back to the 1st Division. Not only did they win all their encounters but also they suffered just one goal in the process (against Melita F.C.)! The team was made up of some of the best elements ever to don the Birkirkara shirt. These included Raymond Cosby, Sunny Borg Cardona, E. Borg, L. Caruana, A. Preca, E. Attard, Valenzia, Manwel Saliba (il-Likku), Joseph Pisani (il-Gross), Sammut Tagliaferro and Frans Bonnici (Lula). This team, in season 1952/53, led Birkirkara to second place in the 1st Division and to the final of the Cassar Cup were they lost to Floriana by a solitary goal. The Birkirkara supporters later labeled the final as the "Briffa Cup" - a tribute to the referee who according to the supporters delivered the cup to Floriana on a silver plate. After this eventual final, Birkirkara remained in the top flight for a period of eight years. Not that these eight years were of any success, as Birkirkara were always hovering above the relegation zone.</p>

<br>
<br>The Stripes were too good for the 2nd Division but were not up to the challenge of the 1st Division giants. Season 1967-68 was the most memorable. Apart from the 2nd Division championship, Birkirkara managed to land the Sons of Malta Cup. Birkirkara beat Gzira United 3-0 in the final to lift the cup.<br>

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The 70's were more exciting than the previous decade. Birkirkara managed to keep their place amongst the elite and established themselves as outsiders to win some silverware. In season 1970-71 Birkirkara had a good cup run and were only stopped by a solitary goal in the semi-finals in a tough contest against Hibernians.
<br>
<br>Season 1972-73 saw Birkirkara challenging as outsiders for their first league title. Floriana started the league tremendously but suddenly hit a bad patch which enabled Birkirkara to creep closer. The ultimate game saw Birkirkara facing Floriana with the winner being declared Champions. The match was a tight affair. Everything pointed towards a draw. The young Floriana striker "Tichy" Grech thought otherwise and scored the match-winning goal in the 77th minute. Birkirkara had been so close but yet so far from their first Championship. A very good cup run followed this league defeat. On the 3 June 1973, Birkirkara faced Gzira United in their first F.A. Trophy final. The match ended 0-0. This was the same result when the teams faced each other again in mid-week. Thus both teams had to meet again for the third time to settle this marathon final. Unfortunately Gzira United scored twice to end another dream. Birkirkara were destined to remain without any silverware.<br></p>

						<strong>1980s</strong></h1>
					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The eighties did not bring about any particular magic. Birkirkara maintained their trend of being promoted in one season only to face relegation in the next. It was only at the end of the 80's did the Stripes supporters have anything to shout about. Birkirkara had a good F.A. Trophy run. In the first round they beat Zurrieq 2-1. This was followed by a 1-0 win over Senglea.
<br>
<br>In the next round, Birkirkara were drawn to meet Valletta but there participation had been withdrawn by the M.F.A. due to previous violence. Hence we were drawn to meet Floriana in the semi-finals. The Greens had just mauled Hamrun Spartans 4-0 in the previous round and hence were already dreaming of the final. Birkirkara, led by a superb Todor Raykov, twice came back from the dead to beat Floriana 3-2 in an exciting semi-final. The final pitted us against Sliema Wanderers. Birkirkara played a shrewd counter attacking game but lady luck once again turned her back on us. In the 90` minute Sliema scored the decisive goal through Hubert Suda. The jinx continued.</p>

						<strong>1990s</strong></h1>
					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">In 1994 Birkirkara F.C. joined forces with Luxol St. Andrews in an attempt to establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with. The team was renamed Birkirkara Luxol. The amalgamation lasted only two years. This project, did not give the results expected. What it did give however, was the force and energy needed to change the team from a small club mentality to a more commercial target oriented organisation. Birkirkara were finally on the right track. In 1996 Birkirkara obtained new premises which were quickly converted into a modern administrative building. From here Birkirkara could embark on various projects. On the 6 December 1996 Birkirkara F.C. registered itself as the first football public company in Malta. This enabled it to register share holders to finance several projects.
<br>
<br>
<br>The team was strengthened and it brought the surprise pack in season 1996-97. In a new league format, played over three rounds, Birkirkara maintained the pace with favorites Valletta right until the very end. The season presented us with several memorable occasions particularly the treble over Sliema Wanderers, a double over Floriana and a hard fought victory over Valletta. Birkirkara ended as runners-up and qualified for the UEFA cup for the very first time. Season 1997-98 saw us competing in Europe for the first time. Birkirkara were eliminated against Spartak Trnava 4-1 on aggregate with new signing Michael Galea being the scorer of our first goal in Europe. The league campaign again saw us challenging Valletta to the very end. In a packed Ta` Qali Stadium, Valletta lowered our hopes with a 2-1 win. It appeared that Birkirkara were really destined to remain without any silverware.</p>

A 4-0 win over Hibernians landed Birkirkara FC the LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u Cup. A similar score against Sliema Wanderers landed Birkirkara FC the Super 5 trophy. Birkirkara were finally laid the ghost!
<br>
<br>The league campaign started off with Valletta racing into the lead with the yellow/reds hot in pursuit. The Lillywhites kept their head and maintained a slender leads over Birkirkara F.C. Both teams met again in the F.A. Trophy final but Valletta managed to beat us. A couple of days after Valletta repeated their feat to land the Super Cup. Birkirkara had lost and ended what appeared to be a promising season on a bad note.</p>

In a new league format Birkirkara started off strongly and were way in front of the chasing pack. Due to the new format, the points were halved and the gap suddenly grew smaller. Two defeats against Hibernians and Pieta H. sent out warning signals. The jinx semed to had struck again. The team however, managed to control the situation and finally delivered. Amongst a carnival atmosphere never witnessed before, Birkirkara thumped their arch rivals Valletta to the tune of 5-1.
<br>
<br>The joy was dented by two poor results against the improving Sliema Wanderers who raced away with both the F.A. trophy and the Super Cup.</p>

<br>In the first honour of the season, the Euro Challenge Cup, Birkirkara registered two draws against Floriana and Valletta, and the latter were the winners of the cup. Just a few days later, Birkirkara were involved in the first round of the Europa League. A first round away-leg goal, was enough for opponents FK Vllaznia to go through to the second round, with a 1-0 aggregate, following a goal-less draw in the second leg played in Albania.
<br>
<br>In the U*BET FA Trophy, Birkirkara eliminated Vittoriosa with a 4-0 score in the third round, but surprisingly they were eliminated in the fourth round, by Hamrun Spartans with a 3-2 score.

<br>
<br>In the U*BET FA Trophy, Birkirkara were once again eliminated in an early fourth round stage. The Stripes eliminated Tarxien Rainbows with a solitary goal, in the fourth round, but they were defeated by Qormi with a 2-1 score to end the Stripes' knock out commitments.
<br>
<br>However, for all the disappointments, Birkirkara bounced back high. In the Premier League, they showed the best football thanks to a collective and versatile squad. A decisive decider-match had to be played as Birkirkara and Hibernians ended their league commitments with level points, something which had not happened in Maltese football in 41 years.
<br>
<br>In the decider, Birkirkara showed great character, when after being a goal down till the half-time, they turned the match around to beat Hibernians with a 3-1 score, They were crowned champions for the 4th time in a season which will remembered by all the Birkirkara clan for the success that the Club managed to achieve.</p>

<br>
<br>Birkirkara kicked-off the season with two excellent displays in the UEFA Champions League where they were drawn against the Slovenian Champions, NK Maribor. Birkirkara held Maribor in a goal-less draw at home but lost with a 2-0 score away, with Maribor advancing to the next round.
<br>
<br>In the first domestic honour, Birkirkara won the BOV Super Cup against Hibernians with a 3-2 score. The Stripes built a comfortable three-goal advantage but Hibernians pulled two back in the second half. For Birkirkara, this was the sixth Super Cup in their history.
<br>
<br>Once again, the U*BET FA Trophy did not bring much luck, as Birkirkara were eliminated in the Quarter-Finals by Qormi with a 3-1 score. Birkirkara reached the Quarter-Finals by beating St. Andrewâ€™s with a 4-0 score in the third round and Vittoriosa with a 4-1 score.
<br>
<br>In the BOV Premier League, Birkirkara showed great potential but they lost the last league match against Valletta, with the latter being crowned Champions therefore leaving Birkirkara finishing in the second place.

<br>
<br>The season started with mixed results in the first round of the UEFA Europa League. The Stripes were drawn against the Hungarian side of Diosgyor VTK. In the first leg played in Hungary, the Stripes were sunk with a goal in added time to lose with a 2-1 score but in the home leg, the foreign were superior and won with a 4-1 score to advance with a 6-2 aggregate score.
<br>
<br>Following the last seasonâ€™s last match, the start of the domestic scene with the BOV Super Cup renewed rivalry between Birkirkara and Valletta. The Stripes won the first final over the Citizens with a 2-1 score to secure their seventh success in this cup.
<br>
<br>In the BOV Premier League, Birkirkara lacked consistency and they failed to give a strong challenge for the title as Hibernians were declared Champions with three games to go. The Stripes ended in the third place to win an automatic place in the UEFA Europa League which meant that the Clubâ€™s record went on.
<br>
<br>The Stripes finished the season in style when after eliminating Valletta in the Semi-Final of the FA Trophy, they produced a magnificent performance to deny Hibernians the double and won the Clubâ€™s fifth FA Trophy thanks to a 2-0 victory.</p>

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Season 2015-2016 was a disappointing one as the Stripes failed to win any silverware. However, they extended their own record by securing a place in European Competitions for the twentieth consecutive time.
<br>
<br>The Stripes enjoyed a very positive campaign in the UEFA Europa League. They qualified for the second qualifying round following beating Ulisses FC with an aggregate 3-1 score and they registered a memorable 1-0 victory over West Ham United FC in the second leg, following a narrow 1-0 defeat in England but West Ham manage to qualify thanks to the penalty shoot out.
<br>
<br>With Hibernians crowned Champions and Birkirkara the winners of the FA Trophy in the previous season, they faced off in the first honour of the season, the BOV Super Cup, and Birkirkara were defeated with a 2-1 score.
<br>
<br>In the BOV Premier League campaign, Birkirkara went through a roller-coaster ride especially when in December they re-shuffled the technical staff and the squad. They placed third with fourty-seven points, six points under Champions Valletta, but enough to secure a place in the UEFA Europa League.
<br>
<br>Birkirkara failed to defend the FA Trophy when despite eliminating Valletta and Floriana in the fourth-round and the quarter-final respectively, they were eliminated by Sliema Wanderers in the semi-final, who went on winning the cup.</p>

					<p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Season 2016-2017 will be remembered for the historic qualification for the third round of the UEFA Europa League. This is a feat that that no Maltese club has ever managed to achieve.
<br>
<br>Birkirkara opened their season by eliminating NK Siroki Brijeg in the first qualifying round with a 2-0 aggregate score. In the second qualifying round, the Stripes wrote history when they eliminated Heart of Midlothian with a 2-1 aggregate score. However, Birkirkaraâ€™s fairy-tale came to an end in the third qualifying round when they were eliminated by FC Krasnodar with a 6-1 aggregate score.
<br>
<br>The Stripes were eliminated from a very early third round from the FA Trophy, when they lost to St. Andrewâ€™s with a 3-0 score.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, the Stripes had a very inconsistent BOV Premier league campaign, including another change in technical staff mid-way through the season, but they produced a strong comeback in the third and last round to end their league commitments in a respective third place.</p>

<br>
<br>Following this unexpected major setback, the club went through several changes as Mr. Frank Zarb was named the new president while Mr. Peter Pullicino was named the new coach.
<br>
<br>Under the helm of the club's thirteenth president, the club made significant improvement after the appointment of Coach Paul Zammit and managed to clinch the all-important fourth place in the BOV Premier League and the final of the FA Trophy to secure a place in European competitions in the following season.</p>

<br>The Stripes' season started on the wrong foot as they were eliminated by KI Klaksvik in the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League with an aggregate score of 3-2.
<br>
<br>The Stripes finished in a disappointing seventh place, while they were eliminated from the Semi-final of the FA Trophy to miss out on a place in European football.</p>

<br>
<br>Birkirkara opened their season`s commitments disappointing in the first phase but improving in January after they re-shuffled the squad. 'The Stripes' managed to get back on track with some positive results. However, due the early termination of the season, 'The Stripes' ended 5th place and miss out on a place in European football.
<br>
<br>Once again, the FA Trophy did not bring much luck, as Birkirkara were eliminated by Floriana in the Quarter-Finals following a penalty shoot-out.</p>

<br>
<br>Birkirkara FC ended in the fourth place in what was another early termination of the BOV Premier League, while the FA Trophy was also terminated. Thus, the Stripes qualified to European competition thanks to their league standings position.</p>
