The British parliament passed the Malta Independence Act in 1964, giving Malta independence from the United Kingdom as the State of Malta, with Elizabeth II as its queen. The country became a republic in 1974. It has been a member state of the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations since independence, and joined the European Union in 2004; it became part of the eurozone monetary union in 2008."},{"page":"timeline.html","anchor":"people03-24","header":"Malta Historical Timeline","body":"2011, May 28 \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tMalta votes in favour of divorce in a referendum.

In 1776, the Order of St. John started to construct a dockyard, which was to play a vital role in the development of this city. During British rule in Malta, the Royal Navy made extensive use of the dockyard, particularly during the Crimean War, the First World War and during the years preceding the Second World War. Cospicua, along with the rest of the area around the Grand Harbour, was heavily bombed during this last war as Malta was under siege by the Axis powers. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tThe Maltese name \"Bormla\" or Burmula derives from Bir Mula that means [the] well of the Lord."},{"page":"dingli.html","anchor":"features012-6l","header":"Ä¦ad-Dingli","body":"Casal Dingli \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tÄ¦ad-Dingli is a village in the Northern Region of Malta, with a population of 3,865 as of 2021.

Apart from the Titular feast of Saint Mary, which is celebrated annually on August 15, other feasts are celebrated throughout the year. These are; the commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ and his rise from death- with the traditional Good Friday procession, which in GÄ§axaq is held on Palm Sunday evening, celebrated a Sunday before Easter, the Main Secondary feast of Saint Joseph celebrated on the first Sunday of June, Corpus Christi on the second Sunday of June, and Our Lady of the Rosary on the second Sunday of October. These are all organized by their respective confraternities. On the night between the 24th and 25th of December, a solemn mass is held to celebrate Christmas. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tZones in GÄ§axaq Bir id-Deheb (Well of Gold) Ä¦as-Saptan (Saptan Town) Il-Miksur (The Broken) Qasam Ä¦al-Dmikki Tal-Barrani (Foreigner's Village) Tal-Garda Tal-Ä ebel (Rocks' Village) Tal-Millieri Tal-Qattus (Cat's Village) Tal-WilÄ¡a (Open Field's Village)"},{"page":"gudja.html","anchor":"features012-7c","header":"Gudja","body":"Il-Gudja \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tGudja is a village in the Southern Region of Malta, with a population of 3,229 as of 2021.

Some of the ancient remains are the cart-ruts, which are parallel channels formed in the rock. Early Christian catacombs, as well as Roman remains, were discovered in Marsaskala, the latter suggesting that Marsaskala was also a Roman port. Remains of Roman baths were found in a field at il-GÅ¼ira, a rock peninsula behind the Jerma Palace Hotel. In 1614, 60 Ottoman ships carrying 6000 soldiers landed at Marsaskala and launched an attack on the south of Malta. Although the battle was a decisive Maltese victory, it brought back fear and terrifying memories of the Great Siege of Malta. Marsaskala's vulnerability to seaborne attacks was reduced by the building of Saint Thomas Tower in late 1565. The tower was financed by Grand Master Alof de Wignacourt and is one of a series of his towers. St. Thomas Tower continued to be used for military purposes until the 19th century and it has been recently restored.In 1659, Å»onqor Tower, one of the 13 De Redin towers was built in the area. This tower was demolished in 1915 by British military engineers. No traces of it can be seen anymore and a pillbox now stands in its place.

It could have been derived from Sqalli (Sicilian) for Marsaskala was frequented by Sicilian fishermen since Malta is just 60 miles (97 km) south from Sicily. Maybe it was derived from the Sicilian 'Piccola Cala' meaning little inlet or it was just a reference to some rock-cut steps on the water's edge since scala also means a straight flight of steps. Marsaskala is better known as Wied il-GÄ§ajn by the Maltese as the bay and the old small village are flanked by two valleys, through which a spring of fresh water used to flow down into the innermost bay.

Nevertheless, the plateau and its surroundings, with a few farmhouses scattered here and there, were in existence for many years well before the area became a parish. The only trace of archaeological evidence were a number of large flat stones found in a field between San Blas Bay and DaÄ§let Qorrot. According to the Gozitan historian Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis these roofed structures, which do not exist anymore, once used to serve as a sort of temple to gods. He also imagined that these slabs of stone couldn't have been placed there by normal people but by very strong people or giants. He also wrote that Nadur may have been founded during the time of the Greeks. One proof of this connection is a bronze statue of Apollo said to be found in Nadur in 1744. Throughout history, Nadur played a very important role in the defence of the island from corsairs, hence the name. During the reign of the Knights of St. John, a watch tower was built by Grandmaster Nicolas Cotoner which has been referred to by DaÄ§let Qorrot Tower or San Blas Tower for the two bays lying on either side of it. The tower is locally known as Isopu Tower. Another watchtower found in Nadur is Ta' Kenuna Tower built by the British towards the middle of the 19th century. It served as a telegraph link between Malta and Gozo. From the top of this semaphore tower, one can see most of the island, Comino and MellieÄ§a with a wonderful view in the winter of the green fields and the blue sea.

For this reason many connect the name Naxxar with Nassar (Nasra) which means 'conversion to Christianity'. The name might alternatively be derived from the Maltese verb \"Naxar\", which means to hang up clothes. Others insist that the name comes from \"Nsara\" or \"Nazaroei\" which means 'those who believe in the teachings of Christ who came from Nazareth and thus \"Nozri\"'. Others say that the word Naxxar means 'one who saws, separates or cuts' â it might be worth mentioning that in Naxxar there are a lot of stonemasons. Magri, in his book says that the word naxar comes from \"nazar\" which in Hebrew means \"chosen for him\" or else \"one who keeps to himself\". This is because in the vicinity the Arabs had formed a village that they called Hal Muselmiet, which means 'the village of the Muslims'. For this reason the Christians started another village â that of the Christians and so the name of Naxxar. Although it has never been clearly explained where the name Naxxar originated, it is a clear fact that there is a close tie with the tradition that the people of Naxxar were the first converts to Christianity. In fact, the parish of Naxxar was the first in the Maltese outskirts, after that of the cathedral (Mdina) and that of Vittoriosa. This is borne out and further evidenced by the village motto â Prior Credidi â meaning the First To Believe. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tZones in Naxxar Naxxar Centre SgÄ§ajtar Area Santa Marija tax-XagÄ§ra San Pawl tat-TarÄ¡a Birguma MagÄ§tab Salina BaÄ§ar iÄ-ÄagÄ§aq Madliena (partly)"},{"page":"paola.html","anchor":"features012-96","header":"Paola","body":"RaÄ§al Ä did \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tPaola is a town in the South Eastern Region of Malta, with 9,339 inhabitants as of 2021.

The remains were found in caves and coastal deposits within the MagÄ§laq Fault or Wied tal-MagÄ§laq. The caves came to light in 1858, when the area began to be quarried for its hard coralline rock which was used to build the docks in the Grand Harbour. Studies were then taken up by Commander Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt in 1861, who excavated a site known as Ä¦alq is-SiÄ¡ar at MagÄ§laq and confirmed the presence of a variety of fossilised animal remains, including an abundance of hippopotami bones, evidence of dwarf elephants, giant dormice, weasels, owls, bats and birds, besides many other snail fossils. The discovery further yielded complete skeletons of elephants and a large number of bones pertaining to sea birds. In around 3600 BC, the temples of Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim and Mnajdra, which are among the oldest freestanding structures in the world, were built in what is now the outskirts of Qrendi. Other ancient sites such as tombs and dolmens have also been found in the limits of Qrendi. The first known documentation of Qrendi is in the militia list of 1417, when it was a small village of 26 households. During Hospitaller rule, various towers were built in or around Qrendi, while some knights built summer residences in the area.

In 1575 when Monsignor Pietro Dusina visited Ä¦al Safi, the residents put their wish forward, but nothing came out of it. At last, in 1592, Bishop Gargallo decided to separate Ä¦al Safi, Imqabba and Ä¦al Kirkop from Bir MiftuÄ§. He amalgamated the three villages into one Parish. Father Carl Taliana from Luqa was appointed as its Parish Priest.

Work on the fort, which was designed by Architect Pedro Pardo, was completed in 1553. Construction of walled town Senglea took place during the following decade. The area, which had until the 1550s been known as Isola di San Giuliano or Isola di San Michele, was given city status by Grand Master Claude De La Sengle and was named after him.Senglea played an important role in the Great Siege of Malta in 1565 and remained unconquered. The city was given the title Civitas Invicta (meaning \"Unconquered City\") by Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette. In 1581 Senglea became a Parish dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady.

Before the arrival of the Order of St John in 1530, there were other thriving hamlets in the area. Little by little Ä¦al Xluq, Ä¦al Kbir, Ä¦al Niklusi and Ä¦al Qdieri were absorbed in SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi and today only their secluded chapels remain. The origins of the name Siggiewi are unknown. The name is unique and bears no resemblance to well-known words. \"Siggiewi\" may be a corruption of an old name. The areas around Siggiewi were inhabited since the Maltese islands were occupied by the first farmers during the Neolithic period. The Neolithic sites of Hagar Qim and Mnajdra (3600-2500 BC) are within walking distance of the village. Also within easy reach of the village are the Bronze Age settlement of Wardija taâ San Gorg, almost at the southern tail end of Dingli Cliffs, and the Bronze Age cart-ruts at ix-Xaghra taâ Ghar il-Kbir (1500-750/800 BC). An early Phoenician tomb was located in the area, but small Phoenician/Punic cemeteries are known on the hill top of tal-Gholja and at ix-Xaghra taâ Ghar il-kbir. In numerous places, Roman pottery scatters are often encountered, suggesting that the environs of Siggiewi were also occupied during the Roman occupation of Malta and Gozo.A series of early Christian catacombs are located close to Maghlaq valley. One of these, published in a number of sources, has been intentionally buried under a field. Siggiewi's patron saint, Saint Nicholas, is perhaps one of the most popular saints in Byzantine hagiography. The survival of the saint's veneration may suggest that following the end of the catacomb era, some of Malta's villages may have retained old traditions that would very comfortably fall within western and eastern Christian domains. Hundreds of place names are known from various fields and locations around Siggiewi. These names are of Semitic character, but are of an unknown age having been recorded in notarial deeds only in the Late Middle Ages. Some of these places developed into hamlets. Others may have supported small communities that were never recorded. These hamlets would later dwindle in importance. The depopulation of the Maltese rural areas during the Great Siege of 1565 hastened the end of small hamlets around Malta and Gozo. The arrival of the Order of St John in Malta in 1530, also ushered in new economic dynamics which made the new urban areas and especially the new city of Valletta more attractive than isolated villages. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tZones in SiÄ¡Ä¡iewi Buskett Bur ix-Xewk Fawwara Girgenti GÄ§ajn il-Kbira GÄ§ar il-Kbir GÄ§ar Lapsi GÄ§ar Mundu Ä¦al-FarruÄ¡ Ä¦esri Laferla Cross (Salib tal-GÄ§olja) Qajjied Rdum Dikkiena Ta' Brija Ta' Nghajsa Ta' Dun Konz Ta' Fonzu Ta' Fuq il-Blat Ta' Kandja Ta' KirÄippu Ta' Raba' Ta' Å»agi Ta' Zuta Tal-GÄ§aqba Tal-Imwiegel Tal-GÄ§olja Tal-Providenza Vina l-Kbira Wied il-Girgenti Wied il-Ä¦esri Wied il-Luq Wied San Anton Wied Xkora"},{"page":"sliema.html","anchor":"features012-al","header":"Sliema","body":"Tas-Sliema \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tSliema is a town located on the northeast coast of Malta in the Northern Harbour District.

The Strand in Sliema is a popular viewing spot for fireworks displays that take place in August.Sliema, which means 'peace, comfort', was once a quiet fishing village on the peninsula across Marsamxett Harbour from Valletta and has views of the capital city. The population began to grow in 1853 and the town was declared a parish in 1878. Now Sliema and the coastline up to neighbouring St. Julian's constitutes Malta's main coastal resort. Sliema is considered a desirable place to live and is relatively affluent, with extremely high property prices compared to the national average. Historically, stylish villas and traditional Maltese townhouses lined the streets of Sliema. Sliema has now been ringed with modern apartment blocks, some of which are amongst the tallest buildings in Malta. This has resulted in significant traffic, parking and construction-related noise pollution issues.

It periodically served as a reference point for the sailors and fishermen in Marsamxett Harbour. The construction age of the church is unknown but it was included in a map by the Order of St. John even before being handed the Maltese islands to them.

At one point the entire peninsula became known as Sceberras.Recent scholarly studies have however shown that the Xeberras phrase is of Punic origin and means 'the headland' and 'the middle peninsula' as it actually is. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tThe city is noted for its fortifications, consisting of bastions, curtains and cavaliers, along with the beauty of its Baroque palaces, gardens and churches.Valletta is twinned with: Palermo, Italy Cortona, Italy, since August 26th, 2022 Byblos, Lebanon"},{"page":"victoria.html","anchor":"features012-ax","header":"Victoria","body":"Il-Belt Victoria, CittÃ  Victoria, Ir-Rabat \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tVictoria, also known among the native Maltese as Rabat (which is the name of the old town centre) or by its title CittÃ  Victoria, is the capital city of Gozo.

This introduction synthesises the main findings under these headings."},{"page":"demographics.html","anchor":"features016-bv","header":"On Census Day, 21 November 2021, the final usual resident population in Malta stood at 519,562, more than doubling over a century, and growing by more than 100,000 over the past 10 years.","body":"Malta remains the most densely populated country in the EU with 1,649 residents per square kilometre. For the first time ever, the 2021 Census recorded more males than females within the Maltese population. There were 270,021 men (52 per cent of the population) and 249,541 women in Malta, resulting in a sex ratio of 924 females per 1,000 males. The average age of the population was 41.7 years, and Gozitan residents were slightly older than the Maltese with average ages of 43.8 years and 41.5 years respectively.Â  More than one in five residents were foreign, with 115,449 non-Maltese persons residing in Malta on Census Day â an increase of more than five times in the share of foreigners since 2011. Just less than 90 per cent of residents were Caucasian, and a further 5.2 per cent were Asian. A total of 6,101 persons (1.2 per cent) had more than one racial origin. A total of 14,822 persons immigrated to Malta in the year prior to the Census â more than three times the figure reported in 2011. More than half of these immigrants were non-EU citizens (including British) and 4,765 were citizens from countries outside of Europe. The majority of the population aged 1 year and over did not internally migrate in the year prior to the Census (93.5 per cent), while 18,558 persons changed their residence. When asked about their religious affiliation, a total of 373,304 residents aged 15 and over (or 82.6 per cent) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. A total of 17,454 persons reported that they belong to Islam, followed by 16,457 persons who identified themselves with the Orthodox religion. Another 23,243 stated that they did not have any religious affiliation."},{"page":"people.html","anchor":"header10-c6","header":"Maltese People","body":"The Maltese people are an ethnic group native to Malta who speak Maltese, a Semitic language and share a common culture and Maltese history. Malta, an island country in the Mediterranean Sea, is an archipelago that also includes an island of the same name together with the islands of Gozo and Comino; people of Gozo, Gozitans are considered a subgroup of the Maltese."},{"page":"people.html","anchor":"header01-c7","header":"Rulers of Malta","body":"The Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo had been ruled by Phoenician, Byzantine and Roman aristocrats, before passing to various European monarchies and eventually a republican government. Foreign monarchical rule over Malta lasted a total of 874 years. The Crown of Malta was patriated from that of the British for the first time in 1964 with the achievement of independence and abolished in 1974 with the establishment of the Republic of Malta. The history, languages and culture of Malta and Sicily share many key events, including occupation by the Fatimids and an invasion by Roger I of Sicily in 1091. The islands parted ways in a decisive and permanent manner in 1799, when Malta became a British Crown colony. British colonial rule over Malta lasted 165 years. For an additional 10 years, Malta retained the British monarch as its independent head of state. Malta adopted a republican constitution on 13 December 1974, ending the monarchy altogether, and joined the European Union on 1 May 2004."},{"page":"people.html","anchor":"header05-c8","header":"Kingdom of Sicily and County of Malta","body":"From the years 1090 and 1530, the Maltese Islands were a non-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Sicily and thus had the same sovereign. At this time the Nobility of Malta resided in or around Mdina. A strong cultural (and, to a lesser extent, political) connection to Sicily survived from 1530 to 1798 throughout the 268-year rule over Malta by the Knights Hospitaller. In terms of the regional divisions of the islands, Malta Island was part the Valle di Demone province, Gozo was part of the Valle di Mazzara province and Comino was part of the Valle di Noto

The Order received major setbacks following the French Revolution, and by 1792 there were serious financial difficulties. Meanwhile, France and the other major European powers began to take an interest in Malta due to its strategic position in the central Mediterranean and its system of fortifications, which was one of the strongest in Europe. By March 1798, the Order had received information that the French were amassing armaments in Toulon. However, it was believed that they were being prepared for an attack on Portugal and Ireland, and Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim did not believe that an attack on Malta was imminent.

Three battalions of the 4th Light Infantry and two battalions of the 19th of the Line landed, and were met by some companies of the Maltese Regiment who offered token resistance before retreating to Valletta. The French forces surrounded the city, being joined by Desaix's troops who had made a successful landing at Marsaxlokk. The Hospitaller defenders then attempted a counterattack and sent out troops against the French, who began to retreat. The Hospitallers and Maltese advanced, but were ambushed by a battalion of the 19th of the Line and were thrown into disarray. The French then began a general advance, and the defenders retreated back to the fortified city. The flag of the Order at the head of the defending force was captured by the French. With Valletta surrounded, Vaubois led some of the troops to the old city of Mdina, where the remaining militia had retreated following the landings. At a city council meeting at the Bishop's Palace, it was decided that resistance was futile and they agreed to capitulate if the people's religion, liberty and property would be respected.

The landing began at around 13:00 in the area of Redum Kebir (Rdum il-Kbir) in the vicinity of Nadur, between the Ramla Right Battery and the Sopu Tower. The defenders opened fire on the French, and they were aided by artillery from the batteries at Ramla and the Sopu Tower.

The force was destined for Egypt, Bonaparte seeking to expand French influence in Asia and force Britain to make peace in the French Revolutionary Wars, which had begun in 1792. Sailing southeast, the convoy collected additional transports from Italian ports and at 05:30 on 9 June arrived off Valletta, the heavily fortified port-city on the island of Malta. At this time, Malta and its neighbouring islands were ruled by the Knights of St. John, an old and influential feudal order weakened by the loss of most of their revenue during the French Revolution. The order was composed of men from across Europe, including a significant proportion of Frenchmen, who ruled over the majority Maltese population of the islands. The head of government was Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, who refused Bonaparte's demand that his entire convoy be allowed to enter Valletta and take on supplies, insisting that Malta's neutrality meant that only two ships could enter at a time. On receiving this reply, Bonaparte immediately ordered his fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic sites around the island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although Valletta was strong enough to hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he and the rest of the expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article04-db","header":"Battle of the Nile","body":"Bonaparte's convoy was pursued across the Mediterranean by a British fleet of 14 ships under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who learned of the invasion of Malta while anchored off Sicily, and subsequently attempted to intercept the French on their passage to Egypt. Nelson's force overtook the French fleet on the night of 22 June in the dark without discovering their presence, and arrived off Alexandria on 28 June ahead of Bonaparte. Believing that the French must have had a different objective, Nelson turned northwards the following day to investigate the coast of Anatolia and missed Bonaparte's arrival on 30 June by less than 24 hours. Unopposed, Bonaparte landed his army and marched on Alexandria, capturing the city and turning inland. The fleet was ordered to anchor in nearby Aboukir Bay and await further instructions. On 1 August, Nelson returned to the Egyptian coast and discovered the French fleet at anchor. Attacking immediately, Nelson's ships managed to capture nine French ships of the line and destroy two, including the flagship Orient with only moderate damage to themselves. The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet granted control of the sea to the Royal Navy, soon joined by the navies of Portugal, Naples, the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire as part of the hastily organised Second Coalition against France."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article02-dc","header":"Maltese uprising","body":"On Malta, the French had rapidly dismantled the institutions of the Knights of St. John, including the Roman Catholic Church. Church property was looted and seized to pay for the expedition to Egypt, an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious Maltese population. On 2 September 1798, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta. Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 irregular Maltese soldiers led by Emmanuele Vitale and Canon Francesco Saverio Caruana. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannons and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article04-dd","header":"French Blockade of Malta","body":"In mid-September, a squadron of Portuguese ships had arrived at the island.

The garrison numbered over 3,000 men and initially at least was well supplied. In the harbour lay the ships of the line DÃ©go and AthÃ©nien and the frigate Carthaginoise, all of which were former ships of the Maltese Navy, as well as the newly arrived Guillaume Tell and frigates Justice and Diane, survivors of the Battle of the Nile under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, which had reached Malta at the end of September."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article02-dg","header":"Capture of Gozo","body":"On 24 October, after a ten-day passage from Naples, Nelson joined the blockade squadron in HMS Vanguard accompanied by HMS Minotaur.

Although the island was formally claimed by King Ferdinand of Naples, it was administered by British and Maltese representatives, whose first action was to distribute the captured food supplies to the island's 16,000 inhabitants. Malta and the surrounding islands were not self-sufficient and quickly the challenge of feeding the population became a strain on the islands' resources, particularly with so many men under arms. Although now formally in command of the islands, King Ferdinand refused to assist with supplies, and the responsibility was left to Ball and his captains to arrange for the transport of supplies from Italy. By the end of the year, the number of Maltese troops in the field had fallen from 10,000 to 1,500, supported by 500 British and Portuguese marines from the blockade squadron. The blockade fleet, consisting of five British and four Portuguese ships, operated from St. Paul's Bay and Marsa Sirocco (now Marsaxlokk) on the island of Malta itself."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article04-dh","header":"Blockade","body":"1799 was a frustrating year for the British and Maltese forces deployed against the French forces, as efforts to secure sufficient forces to prosecute the siege were repeatedly denied. Major-General James St Clair-Erskine, commander of British Army forces in the Mediterranean, considered the ongoing War of the Second Coalition in Italy and the defence of Menorca to be higher priorities than Ball's siege, while the defeated Neapolitans continued to refuse assistance. A Russian squadron under Admiral Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov briefly appeared off the island in January, but was almost immediately ordered to join the Russian and Turkish forces besieging the island of Corfu. In addition to the difficulties the Allies faced in obtaining food for the Maltese population, the French succeeded in bringing supplies through the blockade in the early part of the year: in January 1799 a schooner reached Valletta from Ancona, and in February the frigate Boudeuse evaded the blockade and entered the port with supplies from Toulon. In May, a major French expedition under Admiral Etienne Eustache Bruix entered the Western Mediterranean, forcing Nelson to recall his scattered fleet from across the region, temporarily raising the blockade of Malta. During this operation a number of French supply ships took advantage of the absence of the British squadron to enter Valletta."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article02-di","header":"French Blockade of Malta","body":"However, despite these occasional supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly running out of food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800. Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages. He was replaced on Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply \"Jaloux de mÃ©riter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la nÃ´tre, nous sommes rÃ©solus dÃ©fendre cette fortresse jusqu'Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ©\" (\"Keen to deserve the esteem of your nation, as you seek that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end\"). By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in Palermo. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming closer and closer to Emma, Lady Hamilton, wife of the ambassador Sir William Hamilton. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as Thomas Troubridge, who wrote to him \"If you knew what your friends feel for you I am sure you would cut out all the nocturnal parties . . . I beseech your Lordship, leave off\"."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article04-dj","header":"French Blockade of Malta","body":"In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant-General Henry Edward Fox, who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at Messina to Malta under Brigadier-General Thomas Graham. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to Lisbon. Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an aviso in January 1800 with the news of the events of 18 Brumaire that made Bonaparte First Consul of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article02-dk","header":"Convoy battles","body":"At the beginning of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally agreed to participate in the siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship HMS Queen Charlotte and landed on Malta. For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships of the line, along with a few Neapolitan ships of the line, and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate HMS Success, which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain Shuldham Peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta. These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste PerrÃ©e in GÃ©nÃ©reux, one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier. On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on Alexander. In the ensuing chase, Success captured a French transport and attacked the much larger GÃ©nÃ©reux. Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, Success' second broadside mortally wounded PerrÃ©e and delayed the ship of the line long enough for HMS Foudroyant, under Lord Nelson, and HMS Northumberland to join the battle. Heavily outnumbered, GÃ©nÃ©reux surrendered."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article04-dl","header":"French Blockade of Malta","body":"Shortly after the capture of the GÃ©nÃ©reux, Keith returned to the Italian coast in Queen Charlotte, where his flagship was lost in a fire that killed more than 700 of its crew, although Keith was ashore at the time. Before departing, Keith issued strict instructions to Nelson that he was not to return to Palermo, but was to confine any shore leave in Sicily to Syracuse. Nelson ignored the order and by late March was in Palermo conducting an open love affair with Emma Hamilton. In his absence, Troubridge took over command of the blockade, delegating temporarily to Captain Manley Dixon. Dixon led the squadron on 31 March when Guillaume Tell attempted to break out on Valletta under DecrÃ©s. Spotted by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood, Guillaume Tell was chased northwards and engaged by first Penelope and then by Dixon's HMS Lion, driving both ships back but suffering severe damage. Eventually the arrival of the powerful Foudroyant under Captain Sir Edward Berry proved too much for DecrÃ©s, but he continued fighting for another two hours before he was forced to surrender his battered and dismasted ship; in the engagement, he lost more than 200 men killed and wounded."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article02-dm","header":"Nelson's cruise","body":"In the aftermath of these French defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation.

In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was horse-flesh soup."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article04-dn","header":"French Blockade of Malta","body":"On 23 April, Nelson departed Palermo in Foudroyant, with both Sir William and Emma Hamilton on board as his guests. The party visited Syracuse and then travelled on to Valletta, where Berry took Foudroyant so close to the harbour that the ship came under fire from the French batteries. It was not hit, but Nelson was furious that Emma had been taken into danger and immediately ordered Berry to withdraw. His anger was exacerbated by Emma's refusal to retire from the quarterdeck during the brief exchange. From there, Foudroyant anchored at Marsa Sirocco, where Nelson and Emma lived together openly and were hosted by Troubridge and Graham. Sir William Hamilton, a prominent antiquarian as well as a diplomat, spent his time exploring the island. By early June, Nelson and his party had returned to Palermo, the beginning of a lengthy overland journey across Europe to Britain. Nelson also detached Foudroyant and Alexander from the blockade, again in defiance of Keith's explicit orders, to assist the Neapolitan royal family in their passage to Livorno. Enraged at Nelson's disobedience, Keith publicly remarked that \"Lady Hamilton has had command of the fleet long enough\". In May, Troubridge returned to Britain and was replaced in command by Captain George Martin, while Graham was succeeded by Major-General Henry Pigot."},{"page":"blockade.html","anchor":"article02-do","header":"Surrender","body":"The British blockade continued to prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta during the early summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, fowls or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. So desperate was the need for wood that the frigate Boudeuse, trapped by the blockade, was broken up for fuel by the beleaguered garrison. With defeat now inevitable, Vaubois gave orders that the frigates Diane and Justice were to attempt a breakout for Toulon, with minimal crews of approximately 115 men each. On 24 August, when the wind was favourable and the night dark enough to obscure their movements, the frigates put to sea. Almost immediately, lookouts on HMS Success sighted them and Captain Peard gave chase, followed by HMS Genereux and Northumberland. Diane under Captain Solen was too slow and Peard soon overhauled the under-strength French ship, which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot. The frigate later became HMS Niobe.

In 1810, Salvatore Gatt transferred the lease to Alexander Fernandez, the British Commissariat, and the latter attempted to create a large Maltese colony on the island.

He was autocratic since he refused to form an advisory council made up of Maltese representatives, and so he was informally known as \"King Tom\". He formed the Malta Police Force in 1814, while the local Italian-speaking UniversitÃ  was dissolved in 1819. Various reforms were undertaken in taxation and the law courts as well. Maitland remained Governor until his death on 17 January 1824."},{"page":"crown-colony.html","anchor":"article04-ek","header":"19th and early 20th centuries (1824â1914)","body":"In 1825, the Maltese scudo and the other circulating currencies at the time were officially replaced by the pound sterling, with the lowest-valued coin being a one-third farthing coin minted at irregular intervals, the last such issue occurring in 1913, keeping alive the tradition of the Maltese \"grano\", equal to one-twelfth of a penny.

The year 1828 saw the revocation of the right of sanctuary, following the Vatican Church-State proclamation. Three years later, the See of Malta was made independent of the See of Palermo.

In 1878 a Royal Commission (the Rowsell-Julyan-Keenan Commission) recommended in its report the Anglicisation of the educational and judicial systems.

This was due to the island being overpopulated and largely dependent on British military expenditure which varied with the demands of war. Throughout the 19th century, the British administration instituted several liberal constitutional reforms which were generally resisted by the Church and the Maltese elite who preferred to cling to their feudal privileges. Political organisations, like the Nationalist Party, were created to protect the Italian language in Malta.The last quarter of the century saw technical and financial progress in line with the Belle Epoque: the following years saw the foundation of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank (1882) and the beginning of operation of the Malta Railway (1883); the first definitive postage stamps were issued in 1885, and in 1904 tram service begun. In 1886 Surgeon Major David Bruce discovered the microbe causing the Malta Fever, and in 1905 Themistocles Zammit discovered the fever's sources.

After Filippo Sciberras had convened a National Assembly, in 1921 self-government was granted under British rule. Malta obtained a bicameral parliament with a Senate (later abolished in 1949) and an elected Legislative Assembly. Joseph Howard was named Prime Minister.

This meant that out of 58,000 males qualified by age to be jurors, only 767 could qualify by language, as only Italian had until then been used in the courts.

The first air raids against Malta occurred on 11 June 1940; there were six attacks that day. The island's biplanes were unable to defend due to the Luqa Airfield being unfinished; however, the airfield was ready by the seventh attack. Initially, the Italians would fly at about 5,500 m, then they dropped down to three thousand metres (to improve the accuracy of their bombs). Major Paine stated, \"[After they dropped down], we bagged one or two every other day, so they started coming in at [six thousand metres]. Their bombing was never very accurate. As they flew higher it became quite indiscriminate.\" Mabel Strickland would state, \"The Italians decided they didn't like [the Gladiators and AA guns], so they dropped their bombs twenty miles off Malta and went back.\""},{"page":"crown-colony.html","anchor":"article02-eu","header":"Crown Colony of Malta","body":"By the end of August, the Gladiators were reinforced by twelve Hawker Hurricanes which had arrived via HMS Argus.

The modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is that Malta is derived from the Greek word Î¼Î­Î»Î¹, meli, \"honey\". The ancient Greeks called the island ÎÎµÎ»Î¯ÏÎ· (MelitÄ) meaning \"honey-sweet\", possibly for Malta's unique production of honey by an endemic subspecies of bees. The Romans called the island Melita, which can be considered either a Latinisation of the Greek or an adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation. In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration \"Melite\" in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin. \"Melita\" is the spelling used in the Authorized (King James) Version of 1611 and the American Standard Version of 1901. \"Malta\" is widely used in more recent versions. Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth, \"a haven\", or 'port' in reference to Malta's many bays and coves. Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature, with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary."},{"page":"megalithic-temples.html","anchor":"header05-io","header":"Megalithic Temples of Malta","body":"The Megalithic Temples of Malta are several prehistoric temples, some of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, built during three distinct periods approximately between 3600 BC and 2500 BC on the island country of Malta. They had been claimed as the oldest free-standing structures on Earth until the discovery of GÃ¶bekli Tepe in Turkey. Archaeologists believe that these megalithic complexes are the result of local innovations in a process of cultural evolution. This led to the building of several temples of the Ä gantija phase (3600â3000 BC), culminating in the large Tarxien temple complex, which remained in use until 2500 BC. After this date, the temple-building culture disappeared."},{"page":"megalithic-temples.html","anchor":"header13-ip","header":"Megalithic Temples of Malta","body":"The Ä gantija temples were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980.

The Maltese word for boulders, 'Ä§aÄ¡ar', is common to Ta' Ä¦aÄ¡rat and Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim. While the former uses the word in conjunction with the marker of possession, the latter adds the word 'Qim', which is either a form of the Maltese word for 'worship', or an archaic form of the word meaning 'standing'. Maltese folklore describes giants as having built the temples, which led to the name Ä gantija, meaning 'Giants' tower'. The Maltese linguist Joseph Aquilina believed that Mnajdra (Arabic: ÙÙÙØ¯Ø±Ø©) was the diminutive of 'mandra' (Arabic: ÙÙØ¯Ø±Ø©), meaning a plot of ground planted with cultivated trees (the same usage is colloquial in Egyptian Arabic today); a less likely derivation is from the Arabic root 'manzara (Arabic: ÙÙØ¸Ø±Ø©), meaning 'a place with commanding views.'

There is evidence of human activity in the islands since the Early Neolithic Period (c.â5000 BC), attested by pottery shards, evidence of fires, and bones. The dating and understanding of the various phases of activity in the temples is not easy. The main problem found is that the sites themselves are evolutionary in nature, in that each successive temple brought with it further refinement to architectural development. Furthermore, in some cases, later Bronze Age peoples built their own sites over the Neolithic temples, thus adding an element of confusion to early researchers who did not have modern dating technology. Sir Temi Å»ammit, an eminent Maltese archaeologist of the late nineteenth century, had dated the Neolithic temples to 2800 BC and the Tarxien Bronze Age culture to 2000 BC. These dates were considered \"considerably too high\" by scholars, who proposed a reduction of half a millennium each. However, radiocarbon testing favoured Å»ammit's dating. A theory that the temple art was connected with an Aegean-derived culture collapsed with this proof of the temples' elder origins."},{"page":"megalithic-temples.html","anchor":"header13-is","header":"Temple Phases","body":"The development of the chronological phases, based on recalibrated radiocarbon dating, has split the period up to the Bronze Age in Malta into a number of phases.

The Temple period, from c. 4100 BC to roughly 2500 BC, produced the most notable monumental remains. This period is split into five phases; however, the first two of these left mostly pottery shards.

The western temple at Ä gantija represents, along with other units in Tarxien, Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim and L-Imnajdra, the penultimate stage in development, that is, the introduction of a shallow niche instead of an apse at the far end of the temple. The final stage is testified in only one temple, the central unit at Tarxien, with its three symmetrical pairs of apses. The Temple culture reached its climax in this period, both in terms of the craftsmanship of pottery, as well as in sculptural decoration, both free-standing and in relief. Spiral reliefs resembling those at Tarxien once adorned the Ä gantija temples, but have faded to a level where they are only clearly recognisable in a series of drawings made by the artist Charles Frederick de Brocktorff in 1829, immediately after the temples' excavation. The Tarxien phase is characterised by a rich variety of pottery forms and decorative techniques. Most shapes tend to be angular, with almost no handles or lugs. The clay tends to be well prepared and fired very hard, while the surface of the scratched ware is also highly polished. This scratched decoration remains standard, but it becomes more elaborate and elegant, the most popular motif being a kind of volute."},{"page":"megalithic-temples.html","anchor":"features012-j3","header":"Architecture & Construction","body":"The Maltese temple complexes were built in different locations, and over a wide span of years; while each individual site has its unique characteristics, they all share a common architecture. The approach to the temples lies on an oval forecourt, levelled by terracing if the terrain is sloping. The forecourt is bounded on one side by the temples' own faÃ§ades, which faces south or south-east. The monuments' faÃ§ades and internal walls are made up of orthostats, a row of large stone slabs laid on end. The centre of the faÃ§ades is usually interrupted by an entrance doorway forming a trilithon, a pair of orthostats surmounted by a massive lintel slab. Further trilithons form a passage, which is always paved in stone. This in turn opens onto an open space, which then gives way to the next element, a pair of D-shaped chambers, usually referred to as 'apses', opening on both sides of the passage. The space between the apses' walls and the external boundary wall is usually filled with loose stones and earth, sometimes containing cultural debris including pottery shards. The main variation in the temples lies in the number of apses found; this may vary to three, four, five or six. If three, they open directly from the central court in a trefoil fashion. In cases of more complex temples, a second axial passage is built, using the same trilithon construction, leading from the first set of apses into another later pair, and either a fifth central or a niche giving the four or five apsial form. In one case, at the Tarxien central temple, the fifth apse or niche is replaced by a further passage, leading to a final pair of apses, making six in all. With the standard temple plan, found in some thirty temples across the islands, there is a certain amount of variation both in the number of apses, and in the overall lengthâranging from 6.5m in the Mnajdra east temple to 23m in the six-apsed Tarxien central temple. The external walls were usually built of coralline limestone, which is harder than the globigerina limestone used in the internal sections of the temples. The softer globigerina was used for decorative elements within the temples, usually carvings. These features are usually sculpted in relief, and they show a variety of designs linked to vegetative or animal symbolism. These usually depict running spiral motifs, trees and plants as well as a selection of animals. Although in their present form the temples are unroofed, a series of unproven theories regarding possible ceiling and roof structures have been debated for several years. \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t

The effort is a remarkable feat when considering the monuments were constructed when the wheel had not yet been introduced and no metal tools were available to the Maltese Islanders. Small, spherical stones have been discovered. They were used as ball bearings for the vehicles that transported the enormous stone blocks used for the temples. The temple, like other megalithic sites in Malta, faces southeast. The southern temple rises to a height of 6 m (19.69 ft). At the entrance sits a large stone block with a recess, which led to the hypothesis that this was a ritual ablution station for purification before worshippers entered the complex.

John Otto Bayer, the Lieutenant Governor of Gozo, had the site cleared of debris. The soil and remains were lost without having been properly examined. German artist Charles Frederick de Brocktorff had painted a picture of the site within a year or two prior to the removal of the debris, so he made a record of the site before clearance. After the excavations were conducted in 1827, the ruins fell into decay. The remains were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The land was held privately until 1933, when the Government expropriated it for public benefit. The Museums Department conducted extensive archaeological work in 1933, 1936, 1949, 1956â57 and 1958â59.

As a result of this, the temple has suffered from severe weathering and surface flaking over the millennia. In 2009 work was completed on a protective tent."},{"page":"hagar-qim.html","anchor":"header13-k5","header":"Overview","body":"The megalithic complex of Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim is located on the southern edge of the island of Malta, on a ridge capped in soft globigerina limestone. Globigerina limestone is the second oldest rock on Malta, outcropping over approximately 70% of the area of the islands. The builders used this stone throughout the temple architecture. All exposed rock on the island was deposited during the Oligocene and Miocene periods of geological time. The templeâs faÃ§ade is characterized by a trilithon entrance, outer bench and orthostats. It has a wide forecourt with a retaining wall and a passage runs through the middle of the building, following a modified Maltese megalithic design. A separate entrance gives access to four independent enclosures which replace the north-westerly apse. Features of temple architecture reveal possible associations with fertility rituals, including corpulent figurines and statuary, together with solar alignments and a megalith which it has been argued is phallic. The presence of an altar with a concave top indicated a possible use for animal sacrifices. It has also been suggested that screened doorways at the heart of the complex point towards possible use by oracles. Excavation also uncovered decorated pottery. The best examples can be seen at The National Museum of Archaeology. No burials exist in the temple or the area surrounding Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim, nor have any human bones been discovered in Maltese temples. Bones of numerous sacrificial animals have been found. It is theorized that the Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim complex was built in three stages, beginning with the 'Old Temple' northern apses, followed by the 'New Temple', and finally the completion of the entire structure. A few hundred metres from the temple is one of the thirteen watchtowers built by Grand Master Martin de Redin, called Ä¦amrija Tower. A memorial to General Sir Walter Congreve, Governor of Malta from 1924â1927, is located nearby. The village of Qrendi is a further two kilometres (1.2 miles) southwest of the temple complex."},{"page":"hagar-qim.html","anchor":"header13-k6","header":"Temple Complex","body":"The Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim complex consists of a main temple and three additional megalithic structures beside it. The main temple was built between 3600 and 3200 BC; however, the northern ruins are considerably older. The outside entrance serves as an interior passage and connects six large chambers. The right apse is constructed as an arch to prevent the upright slabs falling inward. The outside wall, built of huge upright blocks, projects inwards, thus creating an extremely solid building. This entrance passage and first court follow the Maltese megalithic pattern but as building progressed, this design was considerably modified. The northwesterly apse was replaced by four independent enclosures. Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim shares its basic architectural design with the Mnajdra, Tarxien and Ä gantija temple complexes.

It has been theorized that this was done to protect the complex from wild animals, which are known to have been plentiful at that time on the islands. It also distinguished the temples as sacred spaces. The Ä¦aÄ¡ar Qim faÃ§ade contains the largest stone used in Maltese megalithic architecture, weighing 57 tons.

The cloverleaf plan of Mnajdra appears more regular than that of Ä¦agar Qim, and seems reminiscent of the earlier complex at Ggantija. The prehistoric structure consists of three temples, conjoined, but not connected: the upper, middle, and lower. The upper temple is the oldest structure in the Mnajdra complex and dates to the Ggantija phase (3600-3200 BC). It is a three-apsed building, the central apse opening blocked by a low screen wall. The pillar-stones were decorated with pitmarks drilled in horizontal rows on the inner surface. The middle temple was built (or possibly rebuilt) in the late Tarxien phase (3150 â 2500 BC), the main central doorway of which is formed by a hole cut into a large piece of limestone set upright, a type of construction typical of other megalithic doorways in Malta. This temple appears originally to have had a vaulted ceiling, but only the base of the ceiling now remain on top of the walls and, in fact, is the most recent structure. It is formed of slabs topped by horizontal courses. The lowest temple, built in the early Tarxien phase, is the most impressive and possibly the best example of Maltese megalithic architecture. It has a large forecourt containing stone benches, an entrance passage covered by horizontal slabs, one of which has survived, and the remains of a possibly domed roof.

On that notion, he contacted the director of the National Museum, Themistocles Zammit, who began to dig even on his first inspection of the site, where he discovered the center of the temple compound. It was not long before Zammit found himself standing in what appeared to be an apse formed by a semicircle of enormous hewn stones. Over the course of three years, Zammit enlisted the help of local farmers and townspeople for an excavation project of unprecedented scale in Malta. By 1920, Zammit had identified and carried out restoration work on five separate but interconnected temples, all yielding a remarkable collection of artifacts, including the famous \"fat lady\" statue, a representation of a Mother Goddess or a fertility charm (according to the Malta Archaeological Museum, the \"fat lady\" statue is genderless, and could represent either a man or a woman) and several unique examples of prehistoric relief, including ships. A small sample of artefacts from the site were donated by Zammit in 1923 to the British Museum. The temples were included on the Antiquities List of 1925.

Other excavations took place in the 19th and 20th centuries. By now, it was thought that the temple was Punic in origin, and that it was dedicated to Melqart. In 1881, the first foundations of the Bronze Age huts in the fields surrounding the temple were discovered. After being excavated, the huts' foundations were reburied for preservation, but the ancient bastion was left exposed. The team leading the excavation restored the wall with new stones where the original ones were missing. The mound of earth that was removed in the excavation of this wall remains there to this day and it is now known as BorÄ¡ in-Nadur Hill. On 31 May 1920, 32 prehistoric silos in the vicinity of BorÄ¡ in-Nadur were destroyed to make way for a new road. Another 41 silos were destroyed when the road was widened later on.

The temples were then extensively excavated by Sir Themistocles Zammit during the British period. Originally there were three temple complexes, but two of these have been destroyed, and only the site of Kordin III survives. The remains were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The temples are located on a plateau overlooking the Grand Harbour, originally called Kortin during the Order of St. John and now Kordin or Corradino. Other megalithic sites in the vicinity include the Hypogeum of Ä¦al-Saflieni and the Tarxien Temples."},{"page":"kordin-temples.html","anchor":"header13-m3","header":"Kordin I","body":"Kordin I was located on a terrace on the west slopes of Corradino Heights, overlooking Marsa. It consisted of small and irregular rooms, and was poorly preserved when it was discovered. It was first surveyed in the 1880s. The first excavations were made by Antonio Annetto Caruana, and were continued under Themistocles Zammit in 1908, and Thomas Ashby and Thomas Eric Peet in 1909. The temple was open to the elements and aerial bombardment during World War II. Virtually nothing remained by the 1950s, and the temple was obliterated after an industrial estate was built on the site in the 1960s."},{"page":"kordin-temples.html","anchor":"header13-m5","header":"Kordin II","body":"Kordin II was located on the northern extent of Corradino, 137 metres away from Kordin I. It was used throughout the entire temple period, since pottery from all phases was found at the site. The chronology was difficult to figure out, and whether the entire building could be dated to the temple period is debatable. The first investigations of Kordin II were undertaken by Cesare Vassallo in 1840. The site was first excavated properly by Antonio Annetto Caruana in 1892, and excavation work continued by Albert Mayer in 1901 and was finished by Thomas Ashby and Thomas Eric Peet in 1908 and 1909. Part of the temple was destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1871 to make way for the ditch of the Corradino Lines, before excavation even began. The temple was further damaged by aerial bombardment during World War II, and no remains of the temple could be seen by the 1950s. In the 1960s, the site was built up as an industrial estate."},{"page":"kordin-temples.html","anchor":"header13-m6","header":"Kordin III","body":"Kordin III is the only temple on Corradino whose remains have survived.

The larger one has a standard 3-apse plan, typical of Ä gantija phase design. The temple has a concave facade, with the forecourt and entrance passage to the central court being stone-paved. This stone paving is unique to Kordin III, as this has not been found in any other temples of Malta. Behind the temple are some small rooms, which were possibly used as storerooms but could have also been an irregular minor temple. The first part of the temple is believed to have been built in around 3700 BC, during the MÄ¡arr phase. Most of the structure dates back to the Ä gantija phase, and the complex was still in use during the Tarxien phase, when the facade was rebuilt. The site is believed to have been abandoned in around 2500 BC. A 2.75 metre-long trough was found lying across the entrance to the temple's left apse, and this is generally considered as the most notable feature of the site. The trough has seven deep transverse grooves produced by grinding. It is made of hard limestone brought from over 2 kilometres away so it is highly probable that it was for grinding corn (a multiple quern) and contemporary with the temple, rather than for grinding 'deffun', the traditional Maltese roofing material, which would make it considerably more recent."},{"page":"kordin-temples.html","anchor":"header13-m8","header":"Excavations & Recent History","body":"The site was cleared from debris by Cesare Vassallo in the 1870s.

Other excavations were undertaken by John Davies Evans in 1953 and by David Trump in 1961. A walled enclosure was built around the temple in 1925, and it is kept locked to give it maximum protection. Like Kordin I and II, the temple was also damaged in World War II, but its remains were not built over after the war and can still be seen today. Although in poor condition, the temple is one of the most complete of the minor temples. In 2009, the viability of extending the World Heritage listing to Kordin III was examined. New excavations of the area around the temple began in 2015 by Caroline Malone and a team of students from the University of Malta. The site was managed by Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna until 2016, when it was handed to Heritage Malta.
