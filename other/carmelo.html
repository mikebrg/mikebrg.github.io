        <h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong>Early Life</strong></h1>
        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">Born into a Maltese Nationalist family in Senglea on 10 August 1915, Borg Pisani enrolled as a student at the pro-Italian Umberto I art lyceum in Valletta. In his teens he attended the network of pro-Italian and pro-fascist organisations in Malta: Valletta's Casa del Fascio (headed by professor Umberto Biscottini) and OGIE (Organizzazioni Giovanili Italiane all'Estero), through which he attended youth camps in Italy, such as Campo Dux in Viareggio in 1930 and another camp in Rome in 1932.
<br>
<br>He moved to Italy to attend the Accademia di belle arti di Roma along with other prominent Maltese artists such as Emvin Cremona. He lived in the Italian government-funded "Casa della Redenzione Maltese", where he met other Maltese irredentists, with whom he shared the conviction that the British colonial government was destroying the "Italian soul" of Malta. He also believed that the best opportunity to restore Malta to its original state was to expel the British and unite the island to the Kingdom of Italy. In Rome, Borg Pisani chaired the "Circolo degli Amici della Storia di Malta" and joined the "Comitato d'Azione Maltese", headed by exiled activist Carlo Mallia from the University of Malta. As Director, Borg Pisani took part in the publication in exile of the irredentist newspaper Malta, which had been forbidden by the British colonial authority.
<br>
<br>Borg Pisani was a supporter of fascism. In 1935, he unsuccessfully tried to embark as a volunteer for the fascist war in Ethiopia.
<br>
<br>Between 1939 and 1940, he joined the Gruppi Universitari Fascisti and then the Partito Nazionale Fascista.<br></p>

        <h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong>During World War II</strong></h1>
        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">After the entry of Italy into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Borg Pisani renounced his British citizenship, returning his British passport through the American embassy (which represented British interests in Rome). Yet he never formally requested nor obtained Italian citizenship, despite later serving in the Italian army.
<br>
<br>He also wrote a letter to Mussolini to volunteer for service, but was refused by the Italian Army due to his strong myopia. Thanks to recommendations, including Biscottini's, Pisani was admitted into the Blackshirts, the fascist militia, and later also joined the Servizio Informazioni Militari, the military intelligence. With the Blackshirts he participated in the Italian occupation of Kefallinia in Greece, where he was injured.
<br>
<br>Together with other Maltese irredentists he then attended the military school of Messina.<br><br>On 18 May 1942, Borg Pisani volunteered for an espionage mission to Malta, to check British defences and help prepare for the planned Axis invasion of the island (Operation Herkules). He disembarked at the Dingli Cliffs in Ras id-Dawwara and transferred all his rations to a cave that he knew well from his youth. Unusually inclement weather and a rough sea, however, washed all his possessions away within 48 hours, and he proved unable to climb the cliffs. He was forced to wave down a local boat. Upon rescue by a British patrol boat, he was brought to the naval hospital RNH Mtarfa.
<br>
<br>There, Borg Pisani was recognized by one of his childhood friends, Cpt. Tom Warrington, who denounced him. British Intelligence kept him under arrest in a house in Sliema till August. He was then transferred to Corradino prison, accused of treason. On 12 November 1942, he stood trial under closed doors in front of three judges, headed by Chief Justice of Malta Sir George Borg, and defended by two lawyers. His plea that he had renounced British citizenship by returning his passport and acquisition of Italian citizenship (which would have granted him the status of prisoner of war) was not upheld by the military court. On 19 November 1942, Borg Pisani was sentenced to death for espionage, for taking up arms against the Government and forming part of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. His execution by hanging took place at 7:30am on Saturday, 28 November, after rejection of pleas for reversal and for clemency. His remains, initially buried inside Corradino Prison, are now in the ossuary of the cemetery of Paola.
<br>
<br>According to Mark Harwood, Borg Pisani might have been betrayed by the Italian Fascists themselves, who by sending him alone on an espionage mission to Malta (where he was very likely to be captured and executed) could have been looking for a propaganda coup against the British with the Maltese population at the height of the war â€” but the plan did not work. Frank Leighton considered him "a gullible victim of fascist Italy's propaganda".<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">The Fascists invested heavily in promoting Italian culture in Malta. They made overtures to a minority who not only loved Italy's language but also saw Malta as a geographical extension of the Italian mainland. Malta was described as "the extreme end of Italian soil" (Senator Caruana Gatto who represented the nobility in Malta in 1923).
<div>
</div><div>The battle, however, was still being fought in largely cultural terms, as the "Language Question" on the role of Italian in education. This led to the revoking (the second) of the Maltese Constitution in 1934 over the Government's budgetary vote for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools. Italian was eventually dropped from official language status in Malta in 1934, its place being taken by Maltese. Italian ceased to be taught at all levels of education and the language of instruction at the University of Malta and the Law Courts. In 1935 there were manifestations against all these decisions, promoted by the Maltese fascists; the Nationalist Party declared that most of the Maltese population was supporting directly or indirectly the Italian Maltese's struggle. But when Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis powers and aerial bombardments of Malta began, what little interest in Italian irredentism that existed in Malta was lost.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The colonial authorities however took precautions; in 1940 they interned and eventually deported to Uganda 49 italophile Maltese including the leader of the Nationalist Party, Enrico Mizzi. Another 700 Maltese with ideals linked to the Italian irredentism in Malta were sent to camps in central Africa.</div><br><div>
</div><div>A number of Maltese living in Italy participated in fascist organizations and joined the Italian military forces during World War II. Among them were Carmelo Borg Pisani, Antonio Cortis, Paolo Frendo, Ivo Leone Ganado, Roberto Mallia, Manuele Mizzi, Antonio Vassallo, Joe dâ€™Ancona and Carlo Liberto.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Carmelo Borg Pisani attempted to enter Malta during the war (Operation Herkules), but was captured and executed as an alleged spy in November 1942. He received the Gold Medal of Military Valor, the highest Italian military award, by King Victor Emmanuel III a few days after his death. Requests have been made by his family and the Italian government to exhume his body and give it a burial outside prison grounds, which request has never been acceded to. Benito Mussolini called him a "Maltese Martyr" and created in his honor in Liguria the Battaglione Borg Pisani in November 1943, in which other Maltese irredentists fought.</div><div>

These "last words" have been taken up by many of his supporters. In Italy, Borg Pisani was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor, the highest Italian military award, by King Victor Emmanuel III a few days after his death.<br><div><br></div><div>Benito Mussolini called him a "Maltese Martyr" and in November 1943 created in his honour in Liguria the blackshirts <em>Battaglione Borg Pisani</em> in which other Maltese irredentists fought.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The art academy where he had studied in Rome was for a brief time rechristened <em>La Regia Accademia di Belle Arti Borg Pisani</em>, and streets in Rome, Turin, Bari and Legnano are still named after him. A neo-fascist group commemorated his death in front of Malta's embassy in Rome in 2010.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Italian historian Giulio Vignoli wrote that Borg Pisani is to be considered one of the last Italian "<em>Risorgimento</em>" martyrs of the Italian irredentism, like Cesare Battisti and Nazario Sauro. Requests have been made by his family and the Italian government to exhume his body and give it a burial outside prison grounds, but so far not acceded to.</div><br><div>
</div><div>In Malta, Norman Lowell, the leader of the far-right political party Imperium Europa, is known to be a staunch admirer of Borg Pisani. He is known for the quotes "<em>Carmelo Borg Pisani, presente!</em>" and "<em>Onore a Carmelo Borg Pisani!</em>" during a tribute to him in an interview on One.</div><br><div>
</div><div>A person similar to Pisani appears in the 1953 film, Malta Story.</div><div>
