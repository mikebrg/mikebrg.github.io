<br>
<br>The Auditor General and National Audit Office Act of 1997 and Standing Order No. 120 of the House of Representatives of 1995 extended the mandate to cover independent advisory and investigative powers; examination of any financial matter concerning use of public funds; as well as Performance/Value for Money evaluation audits of Government Offices and public entities and companies where Government is a majority shareholder. These audits are conducted on NAO's initiative, upon request by the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Public Accounts (Public Accounts Committee), or as requested by the Minister of Finance.
<br>
<br>The Local Councils Act of 1995 also imposed special obligations and responsibilities on the Auditor General and the National Audit Office with regards to the appointment of auditors to Local Councils and their work.</p>

                  <strong>Introduction</strong>
                </h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The National Audit Office is the successor of the Department of Audit that fell under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance up to July 1997. The Office of the Auditor General and the National Audit Office were set up by virtue of the Auditor General and National Audit Office Act, 1997, as well as relevant amendments to the Constitution of Malta.
<br>
<br>Following the coming into force of these important legislative amendments on 25 July 1997 the National Audit Office obtained a clear mandate and empowerment to encourage accountability of public officers and to contribute towards better management of public funds and resources</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Developments necessitating change</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                  The constitutional and legislative provisos established on the attainment of Independence became somewhat outdated as Malta transformed itself from a colony to a modern nation state. Economic growth and political developments translated into increased public expenditure and revenue as the process of growth and diversification of the Maltese economy gathered momentum. Subsequently, such developments led to increased decentralisation and autonomy of line function departments, which had to be counterbalanced with enhanced accountability. The need for more stringent controls relating to the management of public funds and a more effective state audit function became indispensable.
                </p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Setting up of the Public Accounts Committee</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Within this emerging scenario, it was felt necessary to establish a mechanism which facilitated and encouraged discussion and corrective measures to be taken on audit issues through the House of Representatives. This was finally established in March 1995 in the form of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC). This was carried out by means of an amendment, unanimously approved by Parliament, to Standing Orders of the House of Representatives.
<br>
<br>The Committee consists of seven members of Parliament, four from the Government side and three from the Opposition. The Chairman of the Committee is nominated by the Leader of the Opposition after consultation with the Leader of the House of Representatives. The PAC has the power, inter alia, to examine and act on reports made by the Auditor General and has the right to request the Auditor General to submit memoranda on any matter, provided that this is requested by at least three out of the seven members of the Committee. Moreover, the Committee is empowered to report and make recommendations thereon to Parliament.
<br>
<br>The PAC represented an important development to the concept of accountability of the Executive and Legislative branches of Government to Parliament. In addition the PAC served as a catalyst to strengthen the state audit function in Malta.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There was only one logical evolution to the developments outlined above – the establishment of the National Audit Office. In 1997, Parliament unanimously voted for constitutional amendments and ad hoc legislation enhancing and regulating the state audit function in Malta.
<br>
<br>The revised legal framework sought to enhance and consolidate the independence of the state audit function. This was primarily achieved by establishing that the Auditor General be an officer of Parliament. Furthermore, the dependence on the Ministry of Finance and the Office of the Prime Minister for resourcing the Office was removed. The NAO Act further empowered the Auditor General to recruit staff for the Office under conditions that he/she decided upon. 
<br>
<br>The Constitution recognised that the independence of the state audit function would be strengthened and given more credibility if the Auditor General and the Deputy Auditor General were appointed by the President acting in accordance with a resolution of the House of Representatives supported by the votes of not less than two thirds of all the members in the House. This procedure ensures that the Auditor General and his Deputy are accepted as politically unbiased figures. In fact the appointments of both the present Auditor General and Deputy Auditor General won the unanimous support of the House of Representatives.</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>New provisions in state audit legislation</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The independence of the NAO has been further guaranteed though new funding arrangements. The annual estimates considered necessary for the running of the NAO are reviewed by the National Audit Office Accounts Committee prior to consideration and approval by Parliament. Members on this Committee include the Leader of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. The Act also provides for the accountability of the Office. The Committee is obliged to appoint private sector auditors to audit the accounts of the NAO.
<br>
<br>To enhance the effectiveness of the audit reports the NAO Act stipulates that the Auditor General is to submit his annual report to the Speaker of the House not later than one year following the closing of the financial year under review. The Auditor General can also submit other reports to the Speaker of the House on any other issue of significance, materiality or value for money nature. All reports are tabled in the House of Representatives by the Speaker of the House.
<br>
<br>Although previous legislative provisions did not exclude Value for Money (also referred to as Performance) audits, these were, however, given increased prominence with the new legislation. Value for Money audits are a natural consequence of the increased demands by the public for more economic, efficient and effective public service operations. Such demands for value for money and accountability in public service operations are catered for in the Act. The mandate had been extended to cover more clearly all entities holding, administering or using, directly or indirectly, public funds. The philosophy behind such an extension is that in a democracy the citizen is entitled to have a fair and independent appraisal as to whether all public funds are being expended appropriately and judiciously.</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Standards</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The NAO uses the International Auditing Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) as guidelines of practices to be followed in the conduct of its audits. The Office has also developed, and continues to develop, more detailed auditing guidelines in line with these International Auditing Standards.</p>
              </div>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Challenges facing NAO</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The remodelling and strengthening of the state audit function had proved to be timely and of increased significance in view of Malta’s accession to the European Union on 1st May 2004. Such membership carries the obligation to ensure that EU funds transferred to/from Malta are properly controlled and accounted for.
<br>
<br>As already highlighted, the principal function of state audit is to promote accountability, proprietary and best practice in government operations and activities and to provide independent and objective analysis, assurances and advice to Parliament on the way Treasury, government departments and other entities in receipt of public funds use and account for taxpayers’ monies. Consequently, one of the main challenges faced by the NAO is to continuously ensure that it has adequately trained professional staff to enable the Office to carry out its constitutional mandate in the most effective and efficient . This necessitates a carefully planned recruitment programme as well as the provision of ongoing training opportunities, organised within and outside the NAO, to ensure that staff can further their respective professional competencies and skills. This should hopefully enable the Office to attract other professionals to seek a satisfying career in state auditing.
<br>
<br>The extensive challenges faced by the National Audit Office in its efforts to duly fulfill its constitutional mandate have to be seen within the context of the need to continuously renew Malta’s governing institutions, improve public services and stabilise public finances, adapt to the globalised economic environment and oversee the economic, efficient and effective use of EU funding opportunities. It is felt that the National Audit Office has a key role in attaining such strategic objectives and to ensure the country’s continued sustainable development.</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>International Relations</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The NAO gives due importance to its international relations, especially with other Supreme Audit Institutions. The NAO, within its limited resources, views the participation in state auditing-related international events as a fundamental way of sharing and learning from the experiences of our overseas colleagues. We view such an approach as a fundamental way of counterbalancing an ‘insular mentality’ usually associated with small island states.
<br>
<br>The NAO is participating in various international working groups. These include several Working Groups within the EU Member State Supreme Audit Institutions network (so-called Contact Committee), the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions( EUROSAI) Working Group on Good Practices Guide on Audit Quality, and, the EUROSAI, Working Group for Environmental audit.
<br>
<br>Whenever requested, NAO’s views are also submitted on standards, gudelines, and other studies undertaken by INTOSAI, EUROSAI and other international audit institutions.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The democratic process demands that the achievement of proper financial reporting, accountability, propriety and value for money in public administration need to be insisted upon and followed up constantly and vigorously. The taxpayer deserves nothing less. Through the Constitutional and legislative provisions referred to above, the NAO has the necessary mandate and empowerment to execute in an appropriate manner its primary function of serving as the guardian of the public purse and agent for change conducive to achieving excellence in the public sector for the benefit and in the interest of all Maltese citizens.</p>

The Act gives access to eligible persons to documents and information held by public authorities, including all ministries and departments, Government Agencies, as well as any entity established under the law in which the Government of Malta has a controlling interest or over which it has effective control.  
<br>
<br>The Act is an important step forward towards introducing a culture of transparency and accountability in the Public Sector. The Act stimulates open discussion of public affairs and contributes to a positive and informed debate on issues of public interest. 
<br>
<br>The Act does not apply to documents or information held by the NAO. Nevertheless, all the audit reports produced by the NAO are available on NAO’s website www.nao.gov.mt and can easily be downloaded or purchased from the Department of Information.<br></p>

          <strong>Independence of the Auditor General</strong></h1>
        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">NAO is an independent audit institution: its independence is entrenched within the Maltese Constitution and embodied in the Auditor General and National Audit Office Act 1997. 
<br>
<br>The Office follows the INTOSAI principles of independence as set out by the Lima Declaration of Guidelines on Auditing Precepts and the Mexico Declaration on SAI independence.  It strives to maintain organisational, administrative, reporting and financial independence.
<br>
<br>Organisational independence is achieved through the granting of powers by national audit legislation to the Auditor General to determine the organisational structure of NAO.  In fact, the Auditor General is empowered to appoint, on terms as he may determine, such number and such classes of officers as he may consider necessary to assist him in the discharge of his functions according to law.  
<br>
<br>Administrative independence is manifested through provisions in national audit legislation relating to the independence of the Auditor General and his Deputy and NAO staff.  The Auditor General, who is NAO head, and his Deputy, are officers of the House of Representatives and are appointed by the President acting in accordance with a resolution of the House of Representatives supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds of all the members in the House.  Both the Auditor General and his Deputy are appointed for a period of five years that may be renewed for one further period of five years. 
<br>
<br>Moreover, the Auditor General and his Deputy may only be removed or suspended from office by the President, upon an address from the House of Representatives, supported by the votes of not less than two thirds of all members in the House, on the grounds of proved inability to perform the functions of their office (whether arising from infirmity of body or mind), or proved misbehaviour.  
<br>
<br>National audit legislation also stipulates that the Auditor General and NAO Malta are not subject to the influence of any entity or body.  Moreover, NAO staff members adhere to the Professional Code of Ethics, with independence being a key requirement to the effective planning and conduct of any audit.
<br>
<br>All NAO authorised officers are further entitled (as may be required for the proper exercise of their functions according to law) to free access at all reasonable times to information requested from officers and other staff members of government departments or offices, or of bodies subject to audit.
<br>
<br>Reporting independence is also incorporated within state audit legislation.  In fact, the latter imparts the necessary powers to the Auditor General to carry out any type of audit, including financial and compliance audits, performance audits, investigative audits, as well as any other reviews the Auditor General may decide to carry out.  All audits are reported upon to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  The annual audit report on public accounts, in particular, contains an independent opinion on whether the Government financial statements and accounts are fairly presented and are in accordance with the stated accounting policies of the Government of Malta.  There is no interference from users of NAO reports in the planning, execution and reporting of audit results.  
<br>
<br>Financial independence forms an essential element of NAO independence.  The financing of NAO is also regulated by national legislation.  The Auditor General prepares an estimate of the sum he considers necessary to be required to run the Office.  Such a sum is examined by the National Audit Office Accounts Committee.  If such funds prove to be insufficient to meet all expenditure, the Auditor General may prepare supplementary estimates for examination by the above Committee.  The above amounts are considered by the House of Representatives, and if approved, are adopted by a Parliamentary resolution.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">The Public Accounts Committee consists of not more than seven members, four from the Government side and three from the Opposition side. The Committee is chaired by a senior Opposition Member of Parliament nominated by the Leader of the Opposition. It meets periodically when Parliament is in session.
<br>
<br>The main roles of the Committee are to scrutinise and assess the financial administration of the public sector and to promote improvements, where necessary; encourage the economic, efficient and effective utilisation of public sector resources; and enhance the accountability of the executive government to Parliament and the public.
<br>
<br>Reports submitted to the Speaker of the House may be taken up by the PAC, which is empowered to examine the Reports and discuss their contents. In fact, most of the Committee meetings are focused on issues raised in the Annual Report by the Auditor General or Performance Audit Reports. The PAC thereby ensures that audit findings are given due attention.
<br>
<br>The Committee, through at least three of its members, may also request the Auditor General to enquire and report upon matters within his mandate. The Committee is also empowered to take evidence from senior officials of ministries and departments or other government related bodies. Moreover the PAC can also review the activities of non-Departmental organisations that are required to present their accounts to Parliament.</p>

The committee has, as other members, the Chairperson of the PAC, two members from the Government and one from the Opposition. The Committee elects the Chairman from amongst its members. The Committee meets at least once a year and presents to the House of Representatives a report of its activities and the report of NAO’s estimates.
<br>
<br>The accounts of the NAO, which are on an accrual basis, are audited by certified private sector auditors appointed by the Committee. The Auditor General presents the audit report issued by the private sector auditors to the National Audit Office Accounts Committee which is then submitted to the House of Representatives together with any comment thereon by the said Committee.</p>

        <h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong>CIPFA Training Program</strong></h1>
        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-4 display-7">National Audit Office (NAO) staff are professionally qualified in a number of disciplines of relevance to audit work. However, in an ever changing environment, public sector auditors need to stay up-to-date with
<br>developments in public sector auditing and accounting so they can rapidly respond to the demands and expectations of their stakeholders. The NAO Learning and Professional Development Policy provides for the
<br>enhancement of the existing capacity of the NAO in terms of refining skills and competence levels that are required in government finance and auditing. It is within this context that the NAO decided to embark on a
<br>professional development program run by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA).&nbsp;For this purpose, on the 14th of July 2017, the NAO signed an agreement with CIPFA for the delivery of three
<br>modules covering - Audit and Assurance (AA), International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and&nbsp;Financial Crime Investigation and Case Management (FCICM). The courses were to be delivered via blended
<br>learning techniques that include face to face, online and visual classroom training supported with online workbooks, tutor support and webinars.
<br>
<br>CIPFA is the only professional body that caters exclusively for individuals working in the field of public finance.&nbsp;The body promotes optimal performance in public services across the globe, leads the way in public financial
<br>management and extends its professional expertise to a range of sectors where public money needs to be effectively managed.
<br>
<br>The NAO applied for European Social Funding to finance this project under Investment Priority 11i. The Managing Authority approved such undertaking and signed a preliminary agreement with the NAO to&nbsp;implement the said project. The resulting training and certification of NAO staff in the areas of public finance
<br>and accounting would further ensure that NAO staff possess the necessary skills and competences for the carrying out of professional audits thereby continuing to provide a high quality service to Parliament, citizens
<br>and other stakeholders.
<br>
<br>The NAO was pleased to note that out of the present 56 professional employees;
<br>
<br>• 40 employees registered for all three modules – AA, IPSAS, FCICM
<br>• 10 employees registered for the FCICM
<br>• 4 employees registered for Certificates in IPSAS
<br>• 1 employee registered for two modules – AA and FCICM
<br>
<br>In order to ensure a smooth rollout of all training modules, all NAO Staff were grouped into three cohorts. The&nbsp;first two cohorts, each comprising approximately twenty persons, were composed of all staff that registered
<br>for all three modules. The last cohort consisted of the remaining employees who registered for only one to two of the three modules offered.
