<br>
<br>Six burial sites with carved menorahs in the Rabat catacombs (each with a dozen tombs) indicate that Jews lived side by side with Christians and pagans in Malta during the 4th and 5th centuries, during late Roman and then Byzantine times. The community, led by a council of elders (gerousia), could have gathered up to 300 persons.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">There are no archaeological or documentary findings of Jewish presence in Malta during the Fatimid period (870-1090 CE), although in nearby Sicily under the same Arab rule Jews and Christian lived peacefully. Likewise, there is no trace of Jewish presence during Norman rule, from 1091 CE. Only in 1241 the chronicles of Gilibertus Abbate report as few as 25 Jewish families in Malta and 8 in Gozo compared to 681 Muslim and 1,047 Christian families in Malta, and 155 and 203 respectively in Gozo, although the interpretation of these numbers is contested.
<br>
<br>In 1285 the Jewish mystic Avraham Abulafia from Saragozza, expelled from the Jewish community of Palermo, retired to live his last years in solitude on Comino, where he wrote Imrei Shefer, Words of Beauty, or Sefer haOt, Book of the Sign. In 2003 the presumed remains of Abulafia and of other Jewish Maltese of the 1st Century CE were symbolically reburied in the Jewish Cemetery, Marsa.
<br>
<br>In Mdina, during medieval times, the street along the north side of the cathedral (today's Triq il-Fosos) was the Jewish quarter; Jews paid a special tax to the town's Universita, being granted in exchange a monopoly on apothecaries and dyers. In the Militia List of 1419-1420 (a register of male adults in Malta, excluding Birgu and Gozo), the column for "la Giudecca" (the Jewish quarter of Mdina) lists 57 conscripted Jewish men. This leads to an estimate of up to 350 Jews in Malta at the time. Families had typical Jewish surnames such as Meyr/Mejr, Melj, Nefus, Levi, Catalanu, de Marsala.
<br>
<br>In 1479 Malta and Sicily came under Aragonese rule and the 1492 Edict of Expulsion forced all Jews to leave the country. Because they made up such a large portion of the island's population, the Spanish Crown forced them even to pay compensation for the tax losses caused by their own expulsion. It is not clear where the Jews of Malta went, but they may have joined the Sicilian community in the Levant. It is also likely that several dozen Maltese Jews converted to Christianity to remain in the country as did many Sicilian Jews.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">In 1530 Charles V of Spain gave Malta to the Knights of Saint John, who ruled the island until 1798. During these three centuries, there was no free Jewish population on the islands. Those Sicilian conversos who had moved to Malta, attracted by the Knights' liberal policy towards the Jews of Rhodes, had to continue practicing their religion in secrecy.
<br>
<br>Malta was frequently mentioned for its large enslaved Jewish population in Jewish literature of the period. The Knights would capture Jews and Muslims during corsairing raids against Ottoman merchant ships and coastal towns, and keep them hostage in the bagnos (prisons) of Birgu, Valletta or Senglea, to extort ransom. It would be up to Jewish Societies for the Redemption of Captives (Pidion Shevuim) to raise such amounts from Jewish communities across Europe, including Livorno, London and Amsterdam. Failing rescue, Jews would be sold as indentured servants, and given a Christian name, to be freed by the Master only on deathbed. Those Jews (particularly women) who peddled their services as healers and diviners would often face the Inquisition. Those free Jews who wished to visit the islands had to receive a special permission of the Grand Master of the Order and had to enter Valletta's walls through one small port near the Auberge de Baviere, still known as the Jews' Sallyport.
<br>
<br>In 1749 a baptised Jew, Giuseppe Antonio Cohen, revealed to the authorities the plot of a Muslim slave revolt. For his deed, he was granted a pension of 500 scudi and the ownership of a building in Strada Mercanti, Valletta, which from 1773 owned the Monte di Pietà.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The majority of the contemporary Maltese Jewish community originates in Jewish immigration from England, Gibraltar, North Africa, Portugal and Turkey during the short period of French rule from 1798 to 1800 and British rule after that. From 1805 Jews were the targets of campaigns by the Maltese directed against all foreigners.
<br>
<br>The first Jewish families to move to Malta were the Abeasis (Abiaziz) from Gibraltar and the Borges da Silva from Portugal. The teacher Abraham A. Correa arrived in Malta from England in 1809, becoming in 1832 the Hon. Secretary of the British Jews Committee, with Jacob Borges da Silva as president. In 1835, Judith and Moses Montefiore visited Malta, finding only five Jewish families.
<br>
<br>By 1846, the community was large enough to invite Josef Tajar from Tripoli to become the first rabbi since 1492. The synagogue, initially in the Tajar residence at 155 Strada Reale, Valletta, later moved to Spur St (9, Strada Sperone). Following the revolutions of 1848, several impoverished Jewish families from Hungary, France and Germany found refuge in Malta; to cater for their needs, the community appealed to the Pidion and to the Rabbinate of London. A report from 1851 notes that the community was led by Jacob Abeasis, Raffaele Bismot and Riccardo Pariente. The wealthiest families were the Borges da Silva and Sonnino. Many Jews were occupied in commerce or finance, as agents and brokers, while others were shopkeepers and traders.
<br>
<br>In 1863 Sion Attias became the new rabbi after the death of Josef Tajar. Rabbi Fragi Nimni followed in 1878. An 1881 report noted 79 British Jewish residents, 48 Ottomans, 9 Italians, 4 Portuguese, 3 Tunisians and 2 Germans. In the 1890s, with the backing of the achibishopry, a pamphlet was published which recast the Blood Libel against the Jews. The police quickly intervened to ban it. The Jewish community remained very small and in some periods did not have a rabbi. Morocco-born, Portugal-raised Nissim Ohayon was appointed as the last rabbi in 1934, serving until 1956.</p>

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">In the years before World War II, several Jews fleeing Nazism came to Malta, in particular from Austria (Eder family), Italy and Libya (Reginiano family). Numerous Maltese Jews fought in the British Army during the war.
<br>
<br>From 1915 till 1944, the Jewish Community was led by Achille Tayar. He was succeeded by Fortunato Habib in 1944–1963, George Tayar in 1963–1994, and then by Abraham Hayim Ohayon, the son of rabbi Nissim Ohayon.
<br>
<br>In 1953, the World Jewish Congress counted 56 Jews in Malta, represented in the Jewish Community of Malta, headed by Fortunato Habib with George D. Tayar as secretary. The guide states that "The representation of the community is recognized by the Government. Its five-men Working Committee is elected by the membership. Efforts are being made to arrange for regular Jewish and religious instruction."
<br>
<br>In 2019 the Jewish community in Malta gathered around 150 persons, slightly more than the 120 (of which 80 were active) estimated in 2003, and mostly elderly. Many among the newer generations decided to settle abroad, including England and Israel. Most contemporary Maltese Jews are Sephardi, however an Ashkenazi prayer book is used.
<br>
<br>The Maltese Jews found themselves without a synagogue when the building in Spur St. was demolished in 1979. In 1984 a new synagogue was opened at 182 Strada San Orsola, but it had to close down in 1995 as the building was collapsing. In 2000, a new synagogue was built in Ta' Xbiex with donations from the United States and the UK. The Jewish Foundation of Malta now manages it along with a Jewish Center.
<br>
<br>Malta's relations with Israel have been friendly since the former's independence. A direct flight from Tel Aviv brings up to 300 Israeli tourists to Malta each time.
<br>
<br>The local flat bread (ftira) and the traditional Maltese loaf (Ħobż) are both kosher.
<br>
<br>Judaism, along with Hinduism, is recognized as a cult but not as a religion in Malta. In 2010, Jewish and Hindu groups in Malta urged Pope Benedict XVI to intervene to ensure that Malta treats all religions equally before the law.
<br>
<br>In 2013 the Chabad Jewish Center in Malta was founded by Rabbi Haim Shalom Segal and his wife, Haya Moshka Segal.</p>

          Fortunato Habib (1885-1963) was born in Tripoli, the son of Abraham Habib, the chief Rabbi of Benghazi and Tripoli. He moved to Malta in his 20s, soon to start a successful trade in sugar, coffee, and olive oil. Habib established the Lafayette House in Zachary Street, Valletta, upon the franchise of Paris' Galeries Lafayette, dealing in ready-made ladies' fashion, the first such shop in Malta, later expanding in Britannia Street and in Tower Road, Sliema. He is credited (together with the Pace brothers) to have introduced cinema in Malta and to have created the first recordings of Maltese folklore music in 1931, when he accompanied local folk singers, including Is-Semenza and Ix-xudi, to Tunis; 15 titles were recorded there for the German Polyphon label and sold in Malta and to the Maltese communities in Tunis, Alexandria and beyond, via the "Bembaron and Cie" shop. His daughter, Daphne Habib, became a leading concert pianist. Fortunato Habib took over from Achille Tayar as head of the Jewish community during World War II in 1944, leading it till his death in 1963. He is remembered for having helped several other Jewish refugee families, including the Eder, settle in Malta during and after the war; he rests at the Jewish cemetery in Kalkara.

          Hirsch Herman and Helene Eder moved from Vienna with their children to Malta in 1938. With the start of the war, they were interned with other German, Austrian and Italian citizens; they were released after three months. The following year they were interned again in the old convent of Rabat. Once released a year later, they found their hat factory in Msida had been destroyed by Nazi bombing. After the war, they slowly built a chain of five clothing outlets, Haro, which were quite popular among the first ones to sell ready-made women's clothes. The first was in Britannia St in Valletta, later managed by their daughter Lisl Berger. They also owned the Le Roy Hotel in Qui-Si-Sana, Sliema.

        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Jewish cemeteries in Malta include the Kalkara cemetery (1784-1833), the Ta' Braxia Cemetery (1836-1891), and the Marsa Jewish Cemetery (opened 1887).
<br>
<br>In 1372 King Fredrick III granted a piece of land at Tabia (today's Qbur il-Lhud at Ghariexem, Mtarfa) to the Universitate Judeorum, the Jewish community, for use as a cemetery. A Hebrew-language tombstone, found on site, was dedicated to Rach[el], spouse of Yeshu’a; it is now preserved at Rabat's Domvs Romana.
<br>
<br>A Jewish cemetery was established in Kalkara (Strada Rinella) in 1784 "by the Leghorn fund for ransoming Hebrew slaves, at its own expense, for the burial of the dead of its race". The site was likely an earlier burial place for non-Christians on the island. It contains today twelve identifiable graves from burials in 1820–1834, and other gravestones and fragments. It was refurbished by the Local Council in 2003.
<br>
<br>A second burial place for the Maltese Jews was established circa 1836 in a section of the Ta' Braxia Cemetery; it was used until 1891. The Jewish cemetery includes around 120 tombs, mostly in Sefardi-style horizontal slabs.
<br>
<br>Finally, a Jewish Cemetery in Marsa was built in 1879 to designs of Webster Paulson, and opened in 1887 adjacent to the Turkish Military Cemetery, thanks to donations from Jewish English Sir Moses Montefiore The cemetery is still in use by the Jewish community of Malta, and hosts tombs of Jews from Spain, Central Europe and Russia, as well as from places as far away as Australia and Shangai.</p>
